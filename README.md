# Using AI to diagnose patients with pneumonia
### Addressing the shortage of doctors in the US
The issue with the shortage of doctors predates COVID-19. This resulted in longer wait times, and poorer dynamics between patients and physicians. Additionally, when you factor in that doctors now deal with healthcare administration to give their patients proper care, it is no surprise that we are not getting the proper healthcare that we need. Northwell Health, one of the biggest healthcare providers in New York, needs proper patient care so that patients will not only just follow through with their treatment plans, but also may increase patient compliance. So what can we do to improve our healthcare while lessening the burnout that doctors are experiencing? By implementing AI in these hospitals, we can assuage some of the workload without diminishing patient care. Northwell can also use AI to train inexperienced nurses and doctors, [as multiple studies have found that AI is able to perform just as well as medical experts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6716335/). This project will focus on developing an AI model that will be able to diagnose a pediatric patient with pneumonia by reading chest xrays. Hopefully the performance of the model will reassure that AI does have a place in the medical field.
